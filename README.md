The goal is to set out the largest number of tables with identical sets of refreshments, using all of the availablecans of soda. To do that, look for the
largest number which divides evenly into both X and Y. In this case, X=6can be divided by 1, 2 and 3 evenly. And Y=15 can be divided by 1, 3, and 5 evenly.
So 3 is the largest divisorthey both share.
